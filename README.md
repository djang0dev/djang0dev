Hello ðŸ‘‹

## Get to know me

### About

I'm a developer solving merchants'/clients' problems across all components of Shopify with tech as a freelancer or a founder.

From technically managing huge giveaways for a famous youtuber ([La Boiserie](https://www.youtube.com/@thierryvigneauboiserie)) to releasing some publics Shopify apps ([Retailed Size Chart](https://apps.shopify.com/retailed-size-chart-guide) part of [Retailed](https://retailed.io/), TurboBundle)

Obsessed with reducing tech debts/all kinds of feedback loops, I'm working extensively with those cool paradigms: TDD, Actor model / Event-driven architecture, Finite-State Machine, Functional programming, Durable Execution / Workflows Orchestrations.
